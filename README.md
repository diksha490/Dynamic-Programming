# Dynamic-Programming

## Introduction
Dynamic programming is typically applied to optimization problems.In such problems there can be many possible solutions.Each solution has a value and we wish to find a solution with the optimal (minimum or maximum) value.

## Properties of Dynamic Programming
* Optimal substructure
* Overlapping sub problems

## Dynamic Programming Approaches
* Top-down approach(Memoization)
* Bottom-up approach(Tabulation)
